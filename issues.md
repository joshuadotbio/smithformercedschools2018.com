# School Board Candidate & Dad    Shane Smith stands for:

### Inclusion.
Shane will proactively ask for input from parents, teachers, and residents so that our School Board responds to community needs, not checkboxes on the agenda placed in front of them.

### Enrichment.
Investments in teachers pay dividends, and science, arts, and language enrichment should never lose out to standardized testing.
 
### Neighborhood Schools.
Our District must plan and prepare to build a new school to alleviate over-crowding across our District.  We need kids riding their bikes to class, not being driven across town.
 
### Transparency.
Our community should be able to easily understand where the District spends our money.  Parents should never be caught off-guard by school decisions affecting their child’s education.

### Equity.
A child’s ability to access opportunities and services cannot depend on family resources.

### Empowerment.
Our schools must work for all kids.  That means promoting teacher creativity and investing in staff development so that every child is taught by educators who love their job and are at the top of their game.
