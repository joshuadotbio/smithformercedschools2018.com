      <h1>Why vote for Shane?</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Shane Smith.</p>
      <p>Thank you for learning more about me and my campaign to serve parents, teachers, school staff, and the community as the Area One Trustee on the Merced City School District Board of Education.</p>
      <p>I am a parent with significant experience with board governance and a perspective that reflects our community.  Like many Mercedians, I grew up in a working class family that sometimes ran out of money.  That only changed when my mom finished school.  While in high school and college I machined train parts to help pay bills.  Through it all I went to class every day, and I worked hard.</p>
      <p>Today I am a Ph.D.-educated expert in technology law who protects Central Valley businesses in the courtroom.  My experiences confirm that investments in teachers pay dividends, and that science, arts, and language enrichment should never lose out to standardized testing.</p>
      <p>That’s why as a PTC dad I advocated for encouraging teacher creativity to boost achievement, and rallied parent support for affordable afterschool programs for working families.  I partnered with educators to make Merced City schools’ return to Camp Green Meadows a community-wide issue.  And while serving on Merced’s redistricting commission I successfully pushed for outreach to diverse neighborhoods.</p>
      <p>Too often our elected School Board forgets that they are supposed to speak with our voice, like when they recently adopted a plan for $103 million in State funds without any discussion.  That has to change.  I will solicit input from parents, teachers, and residents so that the Board responds to community needs, not just checkboxes offered by career administrators.</p>
      <p>The race for MCSD District 1 offers Merced’s only chance to change the composition of our School Board.  I humbly ask you to help me become the vehicle for that change.</p>
      <p>Please call me at (209) 580-4240 with your questions or to share your views.  Thank you for your vote on November 6th.</p>

      <h1>About Shane</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in the Central Valley and am the product of a public school STEM education.  I earned my college degree at UC Davis in 1997 while working summers in a sheet metal shop.  I then went on to receive a Ph.D. from UCLA in 2003 for studies of brain tumors.  After an exciting few years in public affairs, I earned my law degree from UC Berkeley in 2010 with an emphasis on intellectual property litigation.  I am proud to practice at a top law firm in the Valley where my family lives and my daughter, Selina, is growing up.</p>
      <p><img src="/assets/images/IMG_6787.jpg"/></p>
      <p>But that is only part of who I am.  My grandfather served in World War II and had many stories to tell from his lifelong career in the Army and Air Force.  My dad served in the Air Force during the Vietnam Era.  Together with my mom, Dad taught me the value of hard work and personal accountability from an early age.  My wife, Katrina, and I try to instill those same values in Selina every single day.</p>
      <p>A large part of holding yourself accountability is supporting the people you love.  I remember the uncertainty mixed with joy during that moment at the top of the stairs in our San Francisco row house when Katrina explained that she got a fantastic opportunity to teach and do research at UC Merced.  That was in 2011.  And although I was then with a global law firm in the Silicon Valley, we chose to make our home in the Central Valley.  I am very glad we did.</p>
      <p>We have built lasting friendships and connected with people across the Merced community in ways we never could on the coast.  We are proud to support to education, arts, and health programs right here in Merced.  I am a member of the Board of the Merced Symphony Association, an organization that provides education concerts for Merced City’s 4th graders every single year.  And I have been an active member of the Parent-Teacher Club at Peterson Elementary and now at Burbank Elementary every year my daughter has been in school.</p>
      <p>Speaking with Merced residents about what they want in a school trustee, I learned that they value transparency, accountability, and the perspective of a professional who is a district parent.  They want a trustee who understands our community’s ethnic and social diversity.  They want a trustee who will empower teachers and school staff to boost achievement for all kids.  And they want bold leadership so that our schools will adapt and succeed for years to come.</p>
      <p>I am the only candidate in Trustee Area One who will listen to the community and then deliver what Merced residents and taxpayers want from Our Schools.  And as a Valley kid who grew up in public school classrooms like the one Selina has now, I recognize how our students may achieve their own brand of success through our public schools.</p>
      <p>I would be honored to have your vote to serve as your Trustee on the Merced City School District.</p>
